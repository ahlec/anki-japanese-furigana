JapaneseFurigana is an Anki 2.1 add-on providing support for adding or removing furigana on Japanese content in cards.
It is intended to work cross-platforms, either on `Windows`, `MacOS` or `Linux`.

Japanese readings are generated by [MeCab](https://taku910.github.io/mecab/) and [Kakasi](http://kakasi.namazu.org/index.html.en).

## Usage

Japanese Furigana adds two buttons in the card editor toolbar. When only a portion of text is selected in the field, furigana are only generated for or removed from that selected text portion.

Please note this plugin will only generate furigana using the recommended bracket notation.
Thus this plugin is incompatible with ruby tags generated by other tools.

## Tests

I try to include unit tests as much as possible, you can run them with `python -m unittest`.

## Why

There is already plently of plugins available for Japanese, but most of them are incompatible with Anki 2.1 or do not work on MacOS.
I also wanted a plugin that respects the **KISS principle**, that states that softwares should be kept as simple as possible.

JapaneseFurigana was originally inspired by [ClozeFuriganaTools](https://github.com/golddranks/ClozeFuriganaTools) and
[Simple Furigana](https://github.com/jcsirot/anki-simple-furigana) but has since been refactored to simplify and debloat it and
does not include code from these two projects anymore.
